# ft_printf

## GRADES 100/100

## Introduction
`ft_printf` is a project from the 42 programming school that aims to recreate the standard C library function `printf`. This project helps us understand variadic functions, formatting, and output handling in C, providing a deeper understanding of how formatted output functions work.

## Purpose
- **Master Variadic Functions**: By implementing `ft_printf`, we learn how to handle an arbitrary number of arguments using the `va_list` type and related macros.
- **Improve Formatting Skills**: Gain a solid grasp of formatting specifiers and how to process and output various data types.
- **Create a Versatile Tool**: Develop a versatile `ft_printf` function that can be reused in future projects, ensuring consistent and efficient formatted output.

## Features
The `ft_printf` project includes the implementation of a custom `ft_printf` function that supports various formatting options. Key features include:

### Supported Conversion Specifiers
- `%c` : Character
- `%s` : String
- `%p` : Pointer
- `%d` / `%i` : Signed decimal integer
- `%u` : Unsigned decimal integer
- `%x` / `%X` : Unsigned hexadecimal integer
- `%%` : Percent sign

## Usage
1. clone the repository
2. go inside and execute make
3. you now have the libft_print.a library you can use by including th ft_printf.h file in your programme.
